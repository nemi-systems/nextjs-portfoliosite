# Real-Time Black Hole Simulator

A real-time black hole visualization built with Rust and wgpu. In browsers, it prefers WebGPU on modern hardware and falls back to WebGL 2 when WebGPU is unavailable. This application simulates the visual effects of black holes using a simplified gravitational model with basic frame-dragging approximation, featuring gravitational lensing effects and interactive controls.

## Physics Implementation

### Simplified Black Hole Model
The visualization currently implements a simplified gravitational model with:
- **Basic Event Horizon**: Calculated using approximate Kerr horizon radius

- **Gravitational Deflection**: Basic radial acceleration toward black hole center
- **Cartesian Coordinates**: Simple 3D space without relativistic coordinate systems

### Ray Tracing Method
- **Simplified Integration**: Basic Euler integration with adaptive step sizes in shader
- **GPU Acceleration**: All calculations performed in fragment shader for performance
- **Adaptive Step Size**: Smaller steps near the black hole, larger steps at distance
- **Early Termination**: Rays stop when hitting event horizon or escaping to infinity

### Rendering Pipeline
- **Fragment Shader**: All physics calculations performed on GPU
- **Camera System**: Dynamic FOV with proper perspective projection
- **Uniform Buffers**: Real-time parameter updates from UI controls
- **Background Sampling**: Equirectangular starfield mapping with coordinate grid
